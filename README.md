![Banking Application Banner](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/bank-building-icon-24113387.jpg)

## 📋 Overview

A sophisticated Banking Management System built with a microservices architecture and event-driven design patterns. This application demonstrates modern software engineering practices by leveraging Java, Spring Boot, Docker, and Kafka to create a robust, scalable banking solution.

## ⚙️ Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500)

### Microservices Structure

This application is divided into the following microservices:

- **Account Service** - Manages customer accounts and balances
- **Transaction Service** - Handles financial transactions
- **Authentication Service** - Manages user authentication and authorization
- **Notification Service** - Handles alerts and notifications to customers
- **Customer Service** - Maintains customer profiles and information

### Event-Driven Architecture

The system utilizes Kafka as the backbone for event-driven communication between services:

- **Asynchronous Communication** - Services communicate through events, reducing coupling
- **Fault Tolerance** - Services can continue operation even if others are temporarily unavailable
- **Scalability** - Components can be independently scaled based on demand
